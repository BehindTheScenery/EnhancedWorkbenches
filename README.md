Enhanced Workbenches adds 2, uh, enhanced Crafting Tables! They're capable of storing the items inside them. Crafting Stations (from Tinker's Construct by SlimeKnights) are the simpler version of the two, while the Project Table (from RedPower 2 by Eloraam) also features two rows of additional storage, helping you through all your microcrafting adventures.
